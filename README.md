# Geography 495 Final Project - Mapping Education in Washington State
  
&emsp;The primary focus of our project is education in WA state. The site we would like to develop would be a web-map of Washington schools using a geocoded search to identify schools near to a provided address. The resulting schools would be presented in a sorted list based off of distance from the provided address and would contain supplemental information such as spending. This map could contain multiple toggleable layers for additional analysis such as Washington school districts/counties/libraries. Since families are only interested in schools that their children may attend, we would allow the filtering of school level (elementary, middle, or high school) as well. We plan to do this by loading schools into a layer based on their school level. This will allow the user to toggle school level layers with a radial button. 
  
&emsp;The main audience of this project would be parents or prospective students searching for schools in a target area, potentially in the process of home-buying or moving. A secondary audience could be state policymakers making decisions on where to invest in education; For instance, by displaying which counties may have less schools or schools of a certain type. Using our web-map, policymakers can identify where areas are lacking numbers of schools or libraries. According to the National Public Radio, lack of money for school is a problem in the US. Fundings from state to state, and district to district varies tremendously depending on the wealth of the area. Providing a visualization to the Washington State education officials can help shed light on the areas that are under-resourced for educational opportunities. 
  
&emsp;The primary datasets we plan to use (linked below) are a Washington state schools dataset, a Washington libraries dataset, a Washington school district bounds dataset, and a Washington county bounds dataset, and a dataset that describes the per pupil expenditure on education by school code. The WA schools and per-pupil-expenditure datasets may be combined into one dataset using a join. Potential multimedia could include pictures of schools, short videos of students, and links to other school-finding or educational analysis tools.
